# 🗓️ Day 2: The Console & Comments

## 🎯 Objective
> Learn to use `console.log()` and write effective code comments.  
> Example: “Understand how to log values for debugging and document your code with comments.”

---

## 📚 Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `console.log()` | Displays messages or variable values in the browser console for debugging. |
| Single-line Comments (`//`) | Used to describe one line or a short explanation of code. |
| Multi-line Comments (`/* ... */`) | Used for longer explanations or temporarily disabling multiple lines of code. |

> 💡 Tip: Comments don’t affect your code — they’re for *you* and others to understand what’s going on!

## 💻 Practice Tasks
✅ **SMART Goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):**
1. **Implement:** Write a short script that logs your name, age, and hobby using `console.log()`.
2. **Test:** Add single-line and multi-line comments explaining what each line does.
3. **Reflect:** Note how comments can help make your code easier to understand in future reviews.

## 🧩 Code Example

```js
// My first JavaScript console script

// This line logs my name to the console
console.log("Name: Kevin Kipkemboi");

/*
 This section logs additional info.
 Multi-line comments are great for explaining logic or grouping related code.
*/
console.log("Age: 21");
console.log("Hobby: Coding and learning JavaScript!");

// Try commenting out one of the lines below to see the difference
// console.log("This line is commented out and won't run!");
